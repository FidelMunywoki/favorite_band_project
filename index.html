    <p class="p1-style">
        <strong>5 Seconds of Summer,</strong> often shortened to <em>5SOS</em>  (pronounced as '5 sos'),
        are an Australian pop rock band from Sydney, New South Wales,
        formed in late 2011. The group consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist <strong>Luke Hemmings</strong> ,
        lead guitarist <strong>Michael Clifford</strong> , bassist <strong>Calum Hood</strong> , and drummer <strong>Ashton Irwin.</strong> 
    </p>
    <p class="p1-style">
        They were first formed in Sydney during 2011 and began posting Youtube videos.
        Luke on vocals and guitar, Calum on vocals and bass guitar, and Michael on vocals and guitar.
        In December 2011, Ashton joined the band on vocals and drums. During 2012 they released an EP called 'Unplugged' 
        which reached number 3 on the iTunes chart in Australia and in the top 20 in New Zealand and Sweden. 
        Their international fanbase continued to grow when One Direction's Louis Tomlinson tweeted a link to their song
        'Gotta Get Out'. When 5SOS released their first single 'Out Of My Limit' in November 2012,
        One Direction's Niall Horan tweeted the link to the video clip. On 14 February 2013,
        it was announced that 5 Seconds of Summer would support One Direction on their worldwide Take Me Home Tour. 
        Whilst on a break from the Take Me Home Tour, 5 Seconds of Summer returned home to Australia where they played 
        a National headlining tour, with all dates selling out within minutes. It was around this time when the band began
        to gain popularity and become more well-known. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6513590/bio">Read more..</a>
